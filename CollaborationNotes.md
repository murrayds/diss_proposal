Focusing on Italian researchers between 2001 and 2005, this paper uses co-authorship as a proxy for research collaboration to show that both research productivity and average quality of output increase international mobility. Unlike most research that assumes that internationalization -> increased productivity, this paper tackles the opposite, and finds that a productive and quality scholar is more likely to collaborate internationally. Bibliometric data comes from the Observatory of Public Research in Italy, and focuses on Italians in the Hard Sciences. Productivity and average publication quality (raw count and average number of citations per) are used as performance indicators, and “internationalization indicators” for each author are measure using along dimensions of:

- *“intensity”* (\# of cross-national publications)
- *“propensity”* (#cross-national publications /total publications)
- *“amplitude”* (number of nations involved in cross-national publications). 

There is a strong correlation between productivity and internationalization, and weaker correlation between intensity of international collaboration and average quality of an author’s papers. Physics shows the highest propensity for international collaboration.

We are now in a "fourth age" of research. The first three ages were the individual, the institutional, and the national. The new fourth age is comprised of international teams of elite scholars sharing resources, ideas, and findings between themselves. This new age will cause tensions, as nations can no longer hoard scientific wealth. The nations that thrive will be those that facilitate these expansive international collaborations and open themselves to the world. 

The author explores this finding by examining bibliometric outputs of different countires, and counting the number of internationally-collaborative papers.

A short piece looking at global collaboration networks of univeristies based on co-authorship in the Nature index. They examine specifically how things have changed.

U.S. remains largely tied to Europe. China collaborates with the U.S., but is largely absent from the Asia-Pacific cluster. Australia more closely connected with U.S., but has become stronger in Asia-Pacific. 

"If collaboration is linked with high impact, then research groups who are not part of the collaborative network risk being left behind, marginalized by a lack of access to the cutting edge of research in their field."

A really fun study that examined labs in Paris which, due to asbestos, were forced to quickly and randomly relocate, separating from their former neighbors, and gaining new neighbors in the same building. This provided a unique natural experiment allowint the authors to study how performance changed before and after

- "labs that become colocated because of the moves are 3.5 times more likely to collaborate with each other."
- "separating previously colocated labs does not lead to a decay in collaboration"
- "while colocated labs grow increasingly similar in topics and literature cited, separated ones undertake less correlated research trajectories"
- "By optimizing space based on current beliefs of where opportunities are, organizations are making a strategic choice that will profoundly shape their R&D trajectory. Space acts as a powerful layer of incentives, which can be used to define not only the intensity of interactions, but also their quality."

**Tags:** Interdisciplinarity, Collaboration, Impact

Long-distance, meaning topically-distinct, interdisciplianrity research has higher citation impact than strictly-disciplinary research. The authors find that the majority of interdisciplinary combinations are "win-win", meaning that both disciplines have higher impact than their own averages when cited together. Moreover, the more distance the topics, the greater the impact. Interdisciplinary research is said to be "more than the sum of its parts". 

They measure the topical distance based on the USCD map of science.

**Tags:** Team Science; Team Size; Model

Stasa designs a model of the formation of scientific teams that fits the data remarkebly way. The model is multimodal. Small teams are governed by a poisson process, correponding to the number of people needed to publish a research paper. Large teams are instead governed by a power-law distirbution, such that new members are accumulated based on cumulative advantage of the team's past productivity. 

The methodology is a mix of mathematical modelling, simulation, and fitting parameters to actual data. 

"...team formation is a multimodal process. Primary mode leads to relatively small core teams, the size of which may represent the typical number of researchers required to produce a research paper. The secondary mode results in teams that expand in size, and which are presumably used to carry out research that requires expertise or resources from outside of the core team. These two modes are responsible for producing the hook and the power law-tail in team size distirbution, respectively".

Differences in Collaboration Patterns across Discipline, Career Stage, and Gender. PLOS Biology, 14(11), e1002573. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002573

**Tags:** Collaboration; Team Size; Co-authorship; Discipline; Gender

The authors examine the general structure of collaboration across several disciplines and by gender and career stage. They manually pull faculty rsoters from several U.S. institutions for the 6 departments. They then match these records to their bibliographic information and examine their collaboration.

The main findings are:
- Female faculty have significantly fewer distinct co-authors, but this is accounted for by their lower publication rate and shorter career lengths. 
- Female scientists have a lower probability of repeating previous co-authors than mean, i.e. they don't work with the same people as much
- There is greater evidence of gender segregation in some sub-disciplines, such as molecular biology and genomics.
