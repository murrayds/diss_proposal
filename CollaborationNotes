# Collaboration notes


## Microgeography and the Direction of Inventive Activity

Catalini, 2018

**Tags:** Collaboration; Proximity; Team Science

A really fun study that examined labs in Paris which, due to asbestos, were forced to quickly and randomly relocate, separating from their former neighbors, and gaining new neighbors in the same building. This provided a unique natural experiment allowint the authors to study how performance changed before and after

- "labs that become colocated because of the moves are 3.5 times more likely to collaborate with each other."
- "separating previously colocated labs does not lead to a decay in collaboration"
- "while colocated labs grow increasingly similar in topics and literature cited, separated ones undertake less correlated research trajectories"
- "By optimizing space based on current beliefs of where opportunities are, organizations are making a strategic choice that will profoundly shape their R&D trajectory. Space acts as a powerful layer of incentives, which can be used to define not only the intensity of interactions, but also their quality."


## Principles of scientific research team formation and evolution

**Tags:** Team Science; Team Size; Model

Stasa designs a model of the formation of scientific teams that fits the data remarkebly way. The model is multimodal. Small teams are governed by a poisson process, correponding to the number of people needed to publish a research paper. Large teams are instead governed by a power-law distirbution, such that new members are accumulated based on cumulative advantage of the team's past productivity. 

The methodology is a mix of mathematical modelling, simulation, and fitting parameters to actual data. 

"...team formation is a multimodal process. Primary mode leads to relatively small core teams, the size of which may represent the typical number of researchers required to produce a research paper. The secondary mode results in teams that expand in size, and which are presumably used to carry out research that requires expertise or resources from outside of the core team. These two modes are responsible for producing the hook and the power law-tail in team size distirbution, respectively".


## Long-Distance Interdisciplinarity Leads to Higher Scientific Impact
 
**Tags:** Interdisciplinarity, Collaboration, Impact

Long-distance, meaning topically-distinct, interdisciplianrity research has higher citation impact than strictly-disciplinary research. The authors find that the majority of interdisciplinary combinations are "win-win", meaning that both disciplines have higher impact than their own averages when cited together. Moreover, the more distance the topics, the greater the impact. Interdisciplinary research is said to be "more than the sum of its parts". 

They measure the topical distance based on the USCD map of science. 


## Differences in Collaboration Patterns across Discipline, Career State, and gender

**Tags:** Collaboration; Team Size; Co-authorship; Discipline; Gender


The authors examine the general structure of collaboration across several disciplines and by gender and career stage. They manually pull faculty rsoters from several U.S. institutions for the 6 departments. They then match these records to their bibliographic information and examine their collaboration.

The main findings are:
- Female faculty have significantly fewer distinct co-authors, but this is accounted for by their lower publication rate and shorter career lengths. 
- Female scientists have a lower probability of repeating previous co-authors than mean, i.e. they don't work with the same people as much
- There is greater evidence of gender segregation in some sub-disciplines, such as molecular biology and genomics.
