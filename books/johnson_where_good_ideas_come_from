## Where good ideas come from

**Tags:** Innovation; Collaboration; Ideas

This is a popsci book that explores the history of innovation and tries to give a framework for understanding how good ideas come about. Specifically, Johnson outlines the following concepts:

**The Adjacent Possible:** This is the possibilities of ideas that a system can expore given their current state. Innovation has typically been about exploring and expanding the adjacent posible. 

> "What the adjacent possible tells us is that at any moment the world is capable of extraordinary change, but only certain changes can happen"

**Liquid Networks:** Networks of people, information, ideas, etc., when too dense (solid), do not allow ideas to spread; when networks are too chaotic (gaseous), they fall apart and fracture too easily, not allowing for the adopition of nurtuing of ideas. Liquid networks, those that straddle the line between stability and chaos, are optimal for innovation. Good ideas need to be allowed to spread, but also to be cultivated. 

> "And so, most great ideas first take shape in a partial, incomplete form. They have the seeds of something profound, but they lack a key element that can turn the hunch into something truly powerful. And more often than not, that missing element is somewhere else, living as another hunch in another person’s head. Liquid networks create an environment where those partial ideas can connect; they provide a kind of dating service for promising hunches. They make it easier to disseminate good ideas, of course, but they also do something more sublime: they help complete ideas"

**The Slow Hunch:** Contrary to popular culture, good ideas rarely stem from "eureka" moments. Rather, good ideas often develop from slow hunches over a long period of time

**Serendipity:** New ideas often emerge not intentionally, but through chance encounters between different ideas. We have slow hucnhes in our mind, and sometimes encountering a new, remote idea will complete our hunch into something truly innovative. Liquid networks make these chance encounters more likely. 

> "But serendipity is not just about embracing random encounters for the sheer exhilaration of it. Serendipity is built out of happy accidents, to be sure, but what makes them happy is the fact that the discovery you’ve made is meaningful to you. It completes a hunch, or opens up a door in the adjacent possible that you had overlooked"
> 

**Error:** Good ideas also often emerge as a result of errors, often an accumulation of many errors. Specifically, being wrong forces us to explore and update our beliefs; it forces us to explore the adjacent possibe. Innovative systems, JOhnson argues, are a little bit noisy, and accept a certain amount of error. 

> "Being right keeps you in place. Being wrong forces you to explore…When we’re wrong, we have to challenge our assumptions, adopt new strategies. Being wrong on its own doesn’t unlock new doors in the adjacent possible, but it does force us to look for them"


**Exaptation:** A term that refers to the result of combining things that were not origionally meant to be used together. "Atypical combinations" in the language of some scientific literature. This term origionates from evolutionalry biology to describe how certain biological features can be re-purposed for other uses. Great invensotrs often have many hobbies which allow them to freely and easily connect ideas. 

**Platforms:** These are things that help establish ecosystems of innovation, like coral in a reef of a beaver's dam. In innovation systems, these might be open internet protocols, government data, or YouTube, systems that are open and allow free use. Other times these are spaces that encourage and allow for new ideas, such as the homebrew computing clubs. In other cases, these might be cultural norms that provide frameworks to work within, such as literaty genres and conventions, or scientific paradigms.
