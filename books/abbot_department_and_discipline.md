Abbot explores the relationship between the Chicago School of Sociology and the wider discipline of sociology, arguing that the department became a cultural object, a tradition that reproduced itself across the discipline. This is reflected in the quantiative sociology tradition emerging from the department, one that focused on cities (especially Chicago), race, sociol psychology, and social ecology. Included in his historical analysis is the relationship of the Chicago School to the American Journal of Sociology (AJS), which helped define the discipline. 

The central fact of the chicago school was about contextuality: an interest in understnading social facts in their temporal and spatial context. 

- Social Thing: are not much things but processes, ways of becoming that are charactersitic of particualr contexts. All social things are traditions, and the secret to their thingness is the ways they bind together various preceding traditions in the social process. Different traditions in the social world cross-cut one another. 
- "Theoretical churn": The tendency for papers to dress up minor changes to theories and perspectives as something entirely new
- Functions of a journal:
  - adjudication: the competition of journals meks them unequivicol courts of professional success
  - professional education: by reviewing nearly all papers, journals try to teach people how to be better scholars
  - Social facts: ALl social facts are _located facts_, situated in social time and place. This was a though central to the Chicago school—don't ask about universals, instead ask about, given a time and place, how independent is the variable? 


Quotes: 
- "One of these subtle problems is sociology's failure to consistently attract graduate students comparable in ability to those attracted to anthropology, political science, and economics...Another indicator is sociology's replacement as a policy adviser to governments, a role that has been almost completely taken over by economics. We may belittle economists within the security of our meetings, but they alone have the ear of the prince" (pg 194)
- In a single sentence, the Chicago school thought‚and thinks—that one cannot understand social life without understanding the arrangements of particular social actors in particular social times and places. Another way of stating this is to say that Chicago felt that no social fact makes any sense absented from its context in social (and often geographic) space and social time. Social facts are _located_. : (pg 197)
