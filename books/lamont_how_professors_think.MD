# How professors think

*Lamont, M. (2009). How Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment. Harvard University Press.*

#### Short Summary: 

The authors investigtes the cultural and social dynamics of peer review in academic, drawing on interviews with fellowship peer review panelists in the humanities and social sciences in the U.S. Lamont takes a more cultural and emotiational look at peer review, turning away form the more economic and self-interested theories previously used. In doing so, Lamont reveals a richer and deeper understanding of peer review, one that is driven by self-interest, but also panelists's identieis, their emotions, and their disciplinary styles. 

#### Key concepts:

**Epistemological styles**: The preferences for particular ways of understanding how to build knoweldge, as well as beliefs in the very possibility of proving those theories. Different epistemic communities, disciplines, have different epistemic styles which influence how their members evaluate and understand scholarship. For example, some fields are more positivist, while other contextualist, which will impact how they see other's works. on This concept of epistemic styles builds on Knoor-Cetina's "epistemic culturs". 

**diveristy**: In peer review, diveristy can mean many different things, including gender diveristy, topical diversity, institutional diveristy, geogrpahic diversity, ethinc diveristy, methodological diveristy, and more. 

**Disciplinary sovereignty**: When evaluating as part of a multidisciplinary panel, some panelists will have expertise in certain fields. Authority on the evaluation should be given to the relevant expert when reveiwing a proposal in their discipline. So these experts are said to have some amount of sovereignty over proposals in their discipline. 

**Cognitive contextualization**: The use of dsicipline-specific criteria during evaluation. This is an ideal, and often a necessity, of multidsiciplinary peer review. Panelists must evaluate an English proposal on its merits in English, and an Economics proposal on its merits in Economics. 



#### notes

Humanities more interested in "fascinating" work than "true" work. These fields will also take a more relativistic stance towards evaluation, drawing weaker consensus. 

Economics and history have higher levels of consensus in evaluation than more constructivist fields.

Philosophy is a "problem case" in evaluation. Philosophy proposals are often incomprehensible, don't express their significance, and too insular. Evaluators often don't feel comfortable judging them. Philosophers themselves also believe that *only* philosphers can judge their work, because only they have the necessary skills to do so. All in all, philosophy has a very different culture, standards, and expectations than other fields in this study, which makes evaluation difficult. 


A good panelist typically has the folowing qualities:
- Show up fully prepared and ready to discuss the porposals
- Demonstrate intellectual breadth and expertise
- Be succinct
- Speak across disciplinary boundaries
- Respect other people's expertise and sentiments


The central rules for deliberation:
- Deferring to expertise and observing disciplinary sovereignty. Other people have expertise in their fields, and evaluation should be yielded to them when relevant
- Maintaining collegiality. Don't be a dick. 


Many things can threaten the legitimacy and clear functioning of peer review, including:
- Conflicts and collegiality, such that panelists don't defer to other's expertise or aren't very pleasent people, which damage the process
- inconsistent criteria 
- Gossip, such that panelists know and share irrelevant info about the applicants

Criteria for evaluation, such as "originality", "clarity", and "significance" can have many different definintions, depending on the field and the individual. For example, "significnace" might mean broader social impact to one panelist, but to another can instead mean impact on theory in the academy. In another way, "originality" in one field can mean drawing on new data and archives, but in another can mean the application of a new method or analytical technique. These simple words, like "excellence" itself, have diverse meanings. 

Letters of reference are often not weighted very highly, but they can signal social and cultural capital (i.e., who gets described as "Brilliant"), and those from more elite universities will have more prestigious letter writers to signal their reputation. 

Those from elite univeresities may be valued due to having more resources for grant writing and editing, better letters of reference, and exposure to more "exciting" research. 

Evaluating interdisciplinary research is hard, especially when no one person on a panel has expertise. Panelists will often fall back on their own disciplinary definintions of excellence in such cases. 


Gender bias will often show up, stemming from many possible causes:
- Self-tracking, as in Borfieu's work, such that women sort themselves into less ambitious or exciting topics, often due to cultural stereotypes
- Women may be more likely to do qualitaitve work, which often fares worse in evaluation
- Women are less likely to be described as "brilliant" or other such terms

> "Thus, contra Mreton, Bourdieu, and WHitley, I oppose a view of peer review that is driven only or primarily by a competative logic (or the market) and suggest in addition that peer review is an interactional and emotional undertaking. IN short, building on Gofffman, my analysis suggests the importance of consdiering the self and emotions—in particular pleasure, saving face, and maintaining one's self concept—as part of the investment that academics make in scholarly evaluation. Contra Whitley, I also argue that homoliphic judgements are pervasive across social sciences and the humanities. How people approach evaluation as problem solving, how they develop evaluative practices and articulate their beliefs, and how they represent the process to themselves are crucial to my analysis." (pg 20)

> "Trust in the peer review system is crucial because, by definition, it rejects the vast majority of applicants, who could easily lose faith. Thus this system maintains representations of itself as open and driven by meritocracy, in strong contrast with a not-too-distant past when academia conspiculously favored more culturally homogeneous religious, ethnic, and class elites" (pg 52)

> "...although hiring and promotion decisions are made within disciplinary cultures, such is not eh case for funding decisions made by multidsicplinary panels, which have to create shared evaluations across epistemological and other divides. Thus context primes academics to make explicit their shared, taken-for-granted perspectives as well as their differences—which may range, at the most general level, from the split between humanists and social scientists regarding the proper place of subjectivity in the production of knwoeldge, to divisions over theory, method, and standards of evaluation within and across individual disciplines. Panelists understandings of the challenges facing their disciplines and their expectations regarding what is valued in other fields affect the type of arguments they make for or against proposals." (pg 103)

> "Significance and origonality stand out as the most important of the formal criteria used, followed at a distance by clarity and methods. Informal standards are also  a factor in evaluation and play a significant enough role to be considered part of the normal order of things. This is particularly the case for cultural capital and morality, two considerations that are extraeneous to merit per se. The panelists admire intelletual cirtuosos, risk-takers who offer a counterpoint to the duller, more staid image of the scholar the prevails in the American collective imagination" (pg 199)

Like excellence, diversity appears to have become a moral imperative of teh system—another manifestiation of what is sacred in American academia" (pg 238)
