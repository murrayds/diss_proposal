#### Key terms:

**Intellectual field:** A relatively well-counded and distinct social oranization which controls and directs the conduct of research on particular topics in different ways through the ability of leaders to allocate records according to the merits of intellectual contributions. 

**Reputational system:** A unique form of structuring and organizing work in the sciences centered around the production of novelty and innovation that is evaluated by colleagues in the field, rather than an employer, client, or the lay public. An individual scientist is rewarded by their ability to convince other scientists of the importance of their work, thus generating a *reputation*. This kind of organization creates an *essential tension* between novelty (what science aims to produce) and tradition (what colleagues will accept), that is a central aspect of scientific fields. The specifics of reputational systems—task uncertainty, and mutual dependence—vary across fields based on their centralization, consensus of methods, and audiences.

**task uncertainty:** The degree that the outcomes of research are inherently uncertain. Science as a whole has high task uncertainty, because it is a novelty-producing system. But the exact amount of uncertainty varies by fields. Two aspects of task uncertainty, *technical task uncertainy* and *strategic task uncertainty* further expand this idea. 

**Technical task uncertainty:** The level of uncertainty in how to do thigs, i.e., how much a field is standardized with common methods, approahces, skills, and ways of doing research. Fields with high task uncertainty are largely in the humanities, which have little consensus over research methodology or how to interpret results. In contrast, fields like AI have low technical task uncertainty, because there are clear methods and skills, and clear interpretation of results thanks to benchmarks, performance measures, and accepted test cases. 

**Strategic task uncertainty:** The level of uncertainty in *what* is important or relevant research, and what goals a field should pursue. Fields with high strategic task uncertainty will have more competing theories and groups, and be less centralized—low strategic uncertainty instead results in a highly-centralized field with clear goals; radical change is difficult in such field, although anomolgies can more easily be identified, because the dominant theories are clearly established and accepted. 

  
**Mutual dependence:** This is a feature of a scientific field describing the extent that scientists depend on groups of colleagues to make contributions. For example, Economics and Particle Physics have clear hierarchies of journals and audiences, which leads to a high-degree of mutual dependence. Physics is also hierarchical due to the concentration of resources in the form of labs and equiptment. Humanities, in contrast, has low mutual dependence, and is thus not very hierarchicak, because contributions don't necesarrily depend on a particular or single set of colleagues and their assessments. Mutual dependence is comprised of two aspects: *functional dependence* and *strategic dependence*.

**functional dependence:** How much researchers have to follow specific results, ideas, standards, and procedures of their field in order to make contributions. Increasing functional dependence leads to greater specialization in research topic and method, more standardization, and coordination between researchers and sites. 

**Strategic dependence:** How much researchers  have to convince those in their field of the relevance and importance of their research topic, usually focused around theoretical contribution. High strategic dependence ina  field means that research goals are heavily coordinated, and that there is a high degree of concern over what is being studied and what is significant. 


#### Summary

Whitley lays out his theoretical framework describing how the sciences are organized as a form of *reputational* work system, distinct from other professional systems. What makes science unique is that it pursues novelty (and thus work is uncertain), and the novel products of science are re-used by the community for future research. A scientist's colleages become essential for evaluating their work and providing reputational rewards through grants, citations, promotions, etc. Whitley's framework differentiates between scientific fields based on their level of standardization, centralization, task uncertainty, and dependence on colleagues. 7 archetypical fields are derived, which can be used to describe practically all scientific fields based on their organizational and reputational structure. 


#### Notes


Science is distinct from other professions based off a few things:
- The goal of science is to produce novelty, whether in the form of new results, theories, or methods
- However, the production of novelty comes with a high degree of task uncertainty, meaning what an intellectual contribution is, is not very clear. 
- Novel intellectual contributions are re-incorperated into the scientific community, in the form of citing the findings, using a theory, or applying a proposed method
- Because the community produces *and* uses the novel contributions, reputation becomes the key currency in academia. A contribution has merit, and a scientist rewarded, if they can convince their colleagues of the importance of their work. 
- The entire system of a scientific field is controlled through reputation, where colleagues judge each other's contributions. 


The author details 7 kinds of scientific fields, differentiaged in their degree of technical and strategic task uncertainty, and their degree of functional and strategic mutual dependence. 

- Fragmented adhocracies: lossely-organized fields, little agreement on how to conduct research, or the importance of a result. No centralized groups or stakeholders. Research here is idiosyncratic and diverse. Scope of conflicts is high, but not very intense because people don't depend on others. Examples include fields like Management Studies, Anthropology, etc.,
- Polycentric ologarchies: research is organized around distinct "schools" which are in turn dominated by reputational leaders who control access and distirbution of resources. Coordination is still difficult, but the moderate centralization makes it less fragmented. Each school must demonstrate the importance of their work, and so conflicts can be quite intense. 
- Partitioned bureaucracies: Fields where skills are mostly standardized and work coordinated, but where the significance of results are ambiguous. Sub-groups and schools exist, but are beholden to some central theoretical core. ANglo-saxon economics is an example. 
- Professional adhocracies: Highly standardized in terms of skills and methods, but loosely organized in terms of theoretical focus and significance of research. Prolem boundaries are not strongly enforced. Usually there are abundant resources from various stakeholders, which lowers compeition in the field. An example would be AI research, where tasks and known and interpretable but wherein there is little centralization and many stakehodlers. 
- Polycentric professions: There is some segmentation of problem areas, with separate schools, but researchers also must coordainte within their school and demonstrate their importance to the field as a whole. Reputations rely on coordination of results and strategies. Examples would be most biological sciences. 
- Technologically-integrated bureaucracies:  fields with low task uncertainy (people know what and how to do things), work is systematically planned and conducted around separate problems. The significance of particular research to the wider field is not really important. There is often high-degree of specialization within sub-fields, resulting in less conflict. In these fields, there will be little difference between academic departments and nations, thanks to the standardization. 
- Conceptually-integrated bureaucracies: Fields with a high degree of centralization, both in terms of how research is done (standardized, clear interpretation), and what is important (dominant theories). Often research in these fields is expensive, and relies on complex equitpment and facilities, like modern physics. Certain reputation leaders will have great control over what is studied and how. Boundaries are strongly-enforced. Stable sub-units fork around particualr problems, though thanks to the field's centralization, they have little autonomy. The dependence on the whole field for repoutation means that results and research topics must be highly-coordinated. 






#### Quotes

> "So while cultural production systems in general are characterized by 'a constant and pervasive tension between innovation and control', modern science is surely distinctive in the evaluation of intellectual innovations being so directly tied to their use in producting future novelties" (pg 12) 

-> i.e., science is unique because the products of science (knowledge) is fed back into the system

> "Reputations are won by persuading the relevant audience of the importance of one's work and so affecting their own priorities and ptocedures. Having a high reputation implies an ability to have your own views and ideas accepted as important so that others follow your direction. It also implies an ability to affect the allocation of research resources and, indirectly, hobs in work organizations where reputations control facilities." (pg 26)


> "Essentially, modern scineces are a systems of jountly controlled novelty production in which researchers have to make new contributions to knowledge in order to acquire reputations from particular groups of colleagues. These contributions are assessed in terms of their significance for collective goals and usefulness for others. They therefore have to be different and novel at the same time as being oriented to the work of colleagues and capable of being used by them in their own research. THese conflicting demands create particular tensions between scientists and variations in their mutual balance affect the organization of knoweldges that are produced in different fields. Many of the major differences between the sciences can be derived from these variations" pg 85)
