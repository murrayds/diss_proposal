Summary: The author asks the question 'Why are some countries better at science and technology than others?' He argues that martkets and competition promote innovation, but that market failures are common and need to be remedied. Most typical explanations for innovation countires solving market failures, such as democracy or decentralization, don't actually explain the differences between countries. Instead, *creative insecurity* is the most sensible explanation, whereby countries focus on innovation as a response to external economic or military threats. 

**Cardwell's law**: "No nation has been creative for more than a historically short period. Fortuantely as each leader has flagged there has always been, up to now, a nation or nations to take over the torch" (pg 3). This quote is used to frame the book, to ask why countires are only innovative intermitently.

**Creative insecurity:** The author's explanation for why some countries are better at S&T than others. Technology creates winners and losersâ€”in a country. When domestic politics is outweighted by external ones, the country enters a state of creative insecurity, whereby the losers of innovation will still favor it.

**Market failures**: When the competative economic market, which should theoretically support innovation, fails in some way. This can emerge from things such as monopoly, lack of investmenet, and regulatory capture. Innovation countries need to find a ways of addressing market failures. The specific solutions to market failures don't really matter, all that matters is that a government promotes a situation in which a large number of informed, rational individuals are involved in the free exchange of S&T related goods, services, and capital.

**Network failures**: The social networks of a country can also fail. For example, if local STEM workers cannot access the global social network, they will be distant from emerging technologies and ideas, as well as distant from capital. Innovative economies should also attempt to resolve network failures, such as encouraging brain circulation and importing expertise. Signapore, for example, is successful because it has one of the most well-networked societies in the world. "In capturing and distributing information cheaply, social networks help S&T actors to find one another and to increase ther flexibility to rapid change. In so doing, networks drastically reduce the high costs and risks of innovation" (pg 141)

**Standards**: Technical standards, such as systems of measurement, protocols, etc., dictate how large a network can grow. So while standards can stifle innovation (they can become obsolete, or unecessarily difficult to stick to), they can also allow for larger companies and more interoperability between people in different countires. Therefore, standards are necessary for large innovative economices. 

Innovation clusters: Locations (typically cities) that have a high degree of innovation stemming from the clustering of many businesses of a certain type. Clusters work best when workers are allowed to easily move between firms. Locations are also likely to become clusters when they are seen as "weird", welcoming to a diverse population of iconoclasts. 

The book is actually pretty simple, with most of its time spent going debunking various explanations of why some countires are good at S&T. The author finds that no factor adequetely explaints variance in S&T rates between conutires, not patent laws, funding, political institutions, levels of democracy, cultural unity, or political decentralization. Instead, creative insecurity is the best explanation. 

The author focuses on four case studies: Taiwan, Israel, Ireland, and Mexico. Taiwan and Israel are S&T success stories, whereas Ireland is a mid-tier success and Mexico has been a relative dissapointment. 


The book does a good job of summarizing itself, so below are a series of quotes to help make sense of the book:

Quotes:

"Competition causes innocation, not institutions or policies, and the most compelling form of compeittion is that which takes place between states in the international arena. Without international cpmeptition in the form of external threats to a societies's economic and military security, then national innovation rates tend to slow. External threats matter because they counter the domestic political fights over distribution that kill off the incentives and rewards for innovation. Absent an economic or military imperative to innovation, domestic institutions will not be created, used, or maintained properly to improve national innovation rates. instead, they will be neglected or directed towards other ends, often redistributive or ideological. Thus, it is the balance between domestic rivalries and external threads that ultimately drives national science and technology performance by infleuncing the effectiveness of institutions and policies" (pg 275)

"There is no particular national innovation system, type of government, or variety of capitalism that strongly correlates with successful innovation" (pg 277)

"Innovation creates winners and losers. These two forces battle it out, via politics, over resources and regulations. Certain conditions favor S&T over the victor, while other conditions favor status quo interest groups. Creative insecurity theory posits that the pivotal factor is security. Specifically, all societies confront a combination of domestic rivalries and external threats" (pg 243)
