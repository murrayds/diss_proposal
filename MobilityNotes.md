Appelt et al.,

**Tags:**  Bibliometrics, Mobility

The authors of this OECD report examine what country-level factors influence the flow of researchers across countires, using bibliometric data. Their main findings are:

- Mobility is complicated, better understood as "brain circulation" than as "brain grain/drain"
- Visa restrictions between countires are associated with less mobility
- Mobility also related to economic conditions—similar economies tend to have more shared mobility

**Tags:** Demography, Mobility, Bibliometrics

The authors do a simple bibliometric analysis of "highly-mobile" researchers, those that have been affiliated within at least 3 countries during the period of study. They observe the emergence of the US and China as two large hubs, followered by Germany and France as two smaller hubs for highly mobile researchers. 

I don't really like this paper—they don't really add anything new. Plus, they have a lot of discussion about so-called "super-movers", but don't offer any comparisons to non-mobile or regularly-mobile scholars, meaning that we don't know what is unique to this population. 

The main takeaways are:
- brain circulation a better fit than drain/gain
- US and China have emerged as hubs
- The notion of "super movers" or "peripatetic" scholars, the word derived from Aritotle's school.

**Tags:** Simulation; Modelling; Mobility; Innovation; Implications

The authors build a numerical simulation model based around innovation, and through running it find that "mobility" between groups tends to lead to invreased innovation. They however do not confirm this model with real data, and so it is difficult to do much with this paper except cite it as another example of how mobility is beneficial for innovation

Investigates how "post-doctoral" mobility among German Economics nad Management faculty, that is, institutions held between their PhD-granting and employer institutions, affects publication. Finds evidence that moving univeristies in PostDoc reduces number of publications. This is attributed to a loss in social capital, in temrs of colleagues and collaborators, during the move. This paper exmaines only within-country mobility for German scholars. Also of note: many german universities tacitly require this post-doctoral period. 

- "Mobile researchers with more social ties in the form of coauthors or colleagues at the doctorate granting institution publish less in the years following the doctorate, than their less connected counterparts"
- "With respect to implications of the findings, mobility seems to cause a loss of social capital, which—somewhat surprisingly—not only relates to aresearcher’s weak ties (colleagues), but also to the strong ones, i.e. coauthors. Apparently, coauthorships are still driven by proximity, even given the advances in technology."

**Tags:** OECD; Mobility; Highly-skilled

I haven't read the full report, but the executive summary lays out the following key points:
- The scale and complexity of migration of S&T workers is increasing, playing an important role in shaping the OECD area
- Mobility facilitates the diffusion of knoweldge, particularly tacit knoweldge that is more effectively transferred among individuals with a common social context and physical proximity.
- Economics, but also access to funding and prestigious researchers drive this mobility. Family and personal ties also draw people to be mobile.
- Mobile workers transfer knoweldge. They transfer knwoeldge directly to colleagues, and there is also geographic spillover to nearby individuals and organizations. Mobile S&T workers are as important as the flow of goods and capital across borders
- Receiving countires benefit from the inflow of S&T workers, such as increased R&D and exonomic activity. Mobility can also link domestic firms with foreign knoweldge and expertise. 
- (then)-existing literature was focused on brain drain, but there is this new idea of "brain ciruclation", positing benefits in both directions, that should be considered. 
- For the sending (origin) country, mobility can benefit the creation and diffusion of knwoeldge in the home country. S&T workers going to larger and denser economices can accumulate human capital faster than they could at home
- Brain circulation can stimulate knwoeldge flows and build links between locations. Mobility of S&T workers is not a zero-sum game. But, origin countires should have the infrastructure and institutions to absorb return migrants.
- The existence of a diaspora can further spur knoweldge flows, creating a conduit between countires. In some emerging economies, diaspora networksplay a vital role in developing science and technology capacity
- Most OECD countries are net beneficiaries of highly skilled migration. The United States, Canada, Australia, and France, in  particular, have experienced strongly positive net inflows of tertiary-educated migrants. However, in relative terms, New Zealand and  Ireland  have  experienced  large  outflows. 
- Students are increasingly mobile. Data show that the number ofstudents enrolled outside their country of citizenship has risen sharply since 1995
- Many long-term migrants eventually return to their home contries. The likelihood of doing so for those who are at greater geographic, cultural, and economic distance from their home countries. The  decision  to  return  is  driven  strongly  bylifestyle and family considerations and the availability of attractive employment opportunities at home. For students, the considerations are similar 
- Direct evidence of the impact of mobility on innovation outcomes is hard to find. 
- A clear effect of the mobility of highly skilled workers is the  increasing internationalisation of the labour market for the highly skilled. Both in privateindustry and academia, foreign staff are sought for their specific knowledge orabilities, their language skills and their knowledge of foreign markets
- Opportunities for mobility have been growing. Many countries  havegreatly improved their ability to exploit and perform research and innovationover the past decade. 
- There are many kinds of policies for leveraging mobile S&T workers, but few countires have an explicit strategy for doing so. 
- There are many mobility policies, but they have often not been evaluated. 
- Removing barriers to circular mobility and fostering the diaspora may prove fruitful. Shorter (and potentially repeated) periodsabroad  may avoid some of the obstacles that currently hinder mobility,  and would support knowledge flows associated with brain circulation and  the diaspora
- The growing competition for talent is growing. Many OECD countries  and a growing range of non-member economies aim to attract the same pool of highly skilled researchersand scientists. Relying  extensively on international flows and mobility policies to fill  existing or future gaps in supply may therefore entail risks. Policy will also need to focus on addressing shortcomings in national policiesthat may limit the supply of HRST.

**Tags:** Globalization; Mobility; Visa; Temporal

The authors look at country-level mobility data between 1970 and 2014  and identify several trends in global scientific mobility:
- There is increasing diveristy in origin and destination countires, with the so-called "Global South" becoming more integrated into the global scientific system at the expense of three major regions: North America, Northern Europe, and Western Europe
- The "center of gravity" of scientific knoweldge production and destiniations has been steadily moving eastwards
- The average distnace travelled by mobile scientists has been increasing, reflecting the integration of the "peripheries" into the global science system
- There are significantly lower frictions/barriers to mobility for scientists than for other non-scientist migrants
- But visa restrictions are a statistically significant barrier/friction to the mobility of scientists

Other than that, this paper has really pretty circle graphs and notes that while the shape of mobility has changed, there has been relatively little change in shapes of mobility over the past 40 years. 
- The proportion of scietnsits who had mobility in the last 2 years has been about 3%
- The proportion with mobility in the past decade has been about 9%

**Tags:** Visa; Mobility; Politics


The authors examine the tempral evoltuion of visa policies around the world using a database of national migratory policies. Their findings challenge the notion of a "North-South" mobility divide, instead finding evidence for a multi-polar world made up of regional blocs, wherein travel is more free. In addition, the find,

- That inbound visa restrictions have been stable since the 1970s
- That exit visa restrictions have fell dramatically 
- regional integration drives the liberalization of visa laws
- Countires in sub-Saharan Africa, South, and Southeast Asia have the highest levels of visa restrictiveness in the world


In addition, they also outline a complex array of reasons explaining how visas regimes might manifest
- As domestic political tools to back up rhetoric—for eaxmple, Trump putting bans on certain countires
- As retaliation for a diplomatic incident with another country, or bilateral retaliation in response to restrictions being placed on one country
- As concillatory response, i.e., both agree to lift restrictions

There are also several miscelenous points made about visas and their reasonoings:
- Visas can be required or revoked relatively easily by national governments, making them appealing diplomatic or rhetorical tools
- Might be added as domestic political tools to back up rhetoric—for eaxmple, Trump putting bans on certain countires
- Might be added as retaliation for a diplomatic incident with another country, or bilateral retaliation in response to restrictions being placed on one country
- Could be revoked as a concillatory response, i.e., both agree to lift restrictions
- States that percieve themselves to be, or want to appear democratic might lift exit visa restrictions
- Visas can refelct power asymetries, i.e., if country X imposes visas on country Y, but not the reverse, than country X probably has more political and economic power over country Y
  - This is illustrated in the paper using the cases of the Netherlands, France, and Morocco

### Freeman, R. B. (2006). Does Globalization of the Scientific/Engineering Workforce Threaten U.S. Economic Leadership? Innovation Policy and the Economy, 6, 123–157.

Freeman, 2006

This report from 2006 authored by Richard Freeman, a famous Harvard economist, details four propositions about the state of the globalizing scientific system adn its impats on the U.S.,

1. The U.S. is profucing fewer S&E graduates, and its global share is decreasing rapidly as European and Asian countires, especially China, educate more 
2. The job market has worsened for U.S. workers in S&E fields relative to other occupations, discouraging students from pusruing these degrees. The lack of U.S. S&E graduates has partially been mitigated by a flow of foreign scientists.
3. Populous and (then) low-income countires can compete with the U.S. by producing numerous graduates, even if only a small share of their populations. This could upend global trade and industrial dynamics
4. The United State's comparaing advantage in high-tech is diminishing, which will create a long period of adjustment for U.S. workers

The author calls for new workforce policies to help the U.S. in this transition, policies that build on local strenghts and benefit from the scientific achievemnets of other countries. The main tool the U.S. gov has is R&D spending

**Tags:** Popular; Mobility; Highly-skilled

A short popular-oriented piece arguing that trends in the U.S. fortell losing its advantage in attracting highly-skilled migrants. Since 2016, there are fewer H1-B applicants and fewer postgraduate applicants. Kerr argues these are in part due to:
- hostile political rhetoric
- Outdated and insufficient immigration systems
- Other barrier smaking it harder to establish businesses

**Tags:** Visa; H-1B; Innovation; Pantenting; Highly-skilled

The authors examine the extent to which fluctuations in the H-1B visa cap between 1995 and 2008 relates to the incidence of patenting among those with Chinese and Indian family names in U.S. cities. They find that immigrants are especially important for U.S. innovation. Fluctuations in H-1B admissions significantly influenced the rate of Indian and Chinese patentintg in cities, relative to their peers. Total invention increased with higher H-1B admissions primarily through the contributions of immigrant inventors.

Petersen, 2018

**Tags:** Impact, Discipline, Co-authors, Mobility

The authors examines instances of international mobility and finds that mobile researchers in Physics gain up to a 17% increase in citations relative to similar peers. This increase can be explained by changes in their diveristy of co-authors and topics of interest. It might be the case that migrations afford new opportuniteis to grow social capital and expand/change the immediate, exhausted co-authorship network. 

Other interesting bits:
- "Our findings suggest that career benefits of mobility are common to all ranks"
- "We also fonud that 34% of the mobile researchers in our analysis moved to a location that was not in their sphere of prior collaborations"
- "In this way, migration affords a prime opportunity to phase our old (possibly stagnant) collabroations and research topics in order to make way for exploring new (potentially lucrative) avenues."
- "A hypothetical mechamism that emerges firectly from our analysis of the research diveristy variables is that mobility increases the likelihood of drawing together different intellectual cpacities and professional experience distributed across researchers, which when combined provide a valuable perspective on how to best advance research efforts"

Vaccario, Verginer, & Schweitzer 2018

**Tags:** network; temporal; multi-level; institutions

The authors measure the flow of researchers between institutions, cities, and countries, to assess the strength of collaborative relationships.

This is actually very similar to what I am proposing, however, this paper also has several limitations that I think we can build upon.

- The authors define career trajectories, choosing cities in the case when multiple are present. This assumption does not fit with notions of mobility, which is more circulation than flow.
- The authors use the Medline dataset, which limits their disciplinary focus to biomedical fields
- The authors focus on small subsets of universities/cities
- The authors make measurements based on shortest path distance and trajectories, but this might not be straightforward. For example, if the U.S. U.K. and Japan are connected by a distance of 1, are their relationships really equal?
- The authors have no way to effectively compare between scales or identify deviating examples. I.e., its difficult to calculate a "center" in a graph structure to calculate distance from. We, however, can do this.
- The authors do not have a good means of comparing changes over time

The global economic center of gravity is shifting eastwards, towards China. Projected forward in time, it will eventually sit at the "flat earth" center, meaning that it will match the population center of the world. This paper lays out the approach for calculating economic geographic centers of gravity.

The authors look at scientific production based on country, and calculate the temporal center of gravity of publications from 1900 to 2010. ARound 1900, the center was much nearer to the U.S., however over the decades this has shifted to instead sit somewhere in the Mediterranean. 

The paper mostly works as a brief historical piece, tracking the changing dynamics of scientific production over the century. They also remark on the exponetnial growth in scientific articles, which they attribute to the importance of science worldwide.
