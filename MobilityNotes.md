**Tags:** Migration; General; Temporal; Stocks; Flows

The authors derive values quantifying migration 'flow' between countries from the data of migrant stocks in 196 countires collected by the UN between 1990 and 2010. The amount and nature of migration has changed drastically over the course of this period, decreasing in the 1990-2000 period due to the ending of several armed conflicts and crises. Specific findings include:

- African migrants in Sub-Saharan Africa primarily migrate within the continent
- Migration flows originating in Asia and South America tended to be more sptially focused than were flows out of Europe
- Almost all the largest flows occured within or to neighboring regions, though some stand out, such as flows between South Asia to North America and from South America to Southern Europe. 

The primary contribution of this paper is mostly methodological—they propose a means of understanding global migration flows based on changes in migration stock data.

Fidnigs from an online survey are used to assess European social scientist's feelings on mobility. In Europe, mobility is seen as universally beneficial, and is sometimes required for career, becoming yet another evaluative metric. Ackers shows that mobility is a far more complex phenomenon than previously believed. 
- Not all mobility is beneficial for the applicant, and sometimes the need to appear “mobile” or “international” will lead a researcher to pursue low-quality research visits and stays with little benefit
- Mobility as a metric can  be discriminatory, both to discipline and personal life style: if one’s research is qualitative and reliant on a local sociological or anthropological context, then mobility that distances them from that context may offer no benefit to the researcher. 
- Those with financial constraints, families, and disabilities may find it impossible to be mobile to the extent often required for their career
- The financial cost could be greater for long-term research visits, often seen as necessary, although some responses reveal that short-term research visits combined with virtual mobility and collaboration work just as well. 

Overall, this study takes a decidedly human approach to understand the issues and nuances of mobility, and how care must be taken when introducing it as a metric.

**Tags:** Economics; Elite; Categroies; Brain Drain; Brain Circulation

This paper analyzes the career mobility of economists who were then-working at the top economics departments in the world. The particular contribution is the delineation between three different types of mobility: 

- **stayers:**, those who have never left their country or origin, 
- **brain drain:** who have left their home country and were still working abroad, 
- **brain circulation:** those who left their home country and then returned. 

Departments were selected by examining publications to economics research journals that were ranked in 2003, and then data was collected from the web pages of these departments in 2007. 
- This population of researchers was highly productive but also highly skewed (with a minority of researcher publishing the most in the top-tier journals). 
- Most researchers currently working in these top departments also came from top departments. 

The main contributions of this paper are a better understanding of elite mobility, and also analysis of the different types of mobility.

Robert Merton originally stated that science should be universalistic, requiring that scientific careers be open to talent and those who best fulfilled their roles, but many challenge that in reality science is not universalistic, and that the prestige of the academic department and advisor granting the doctorate are more important than scientific performance. 

This paper tests this assumption by following 274 job changes by unique 242 scientists (roughly equal proportions of biologists, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians) at one academic institution between 1961 and 1975, and find that **“to obtain a prestigious job, it is more effective to get a degree at a top-rated graduate program than to be extremely productive**. “ They also find that while the number of articles an applicant has is important to prestige mobility, the number of citations is not, although the number of citations do prove to be important for promotions in rank when changing jobs. While Merton calls for the ideal of universalism, at the time of his paper’s publication, the ideal appears distant.

**Tags:** globalization; univeristy; international

The auhtors discuss the internationalization of univeristies, detailing at length examples of international initiatives, policies, and partnerships by continent. Univeristies have been globalizing, and this has meant that they have also been internationalizing.
- Motives to internationalize include profits, providing wider access to education, providing international cross-cultural perspectives to students, encouraging political integration (as with the EU), improving the quality, prestige, and cultural composition of programs (mostly with developing countires), and the demands of individual self-funded students seeking cross-cultural experiences
- Virtually all countries have international programs of some form, though the biggest "sellers" are by far North America and Europe. 

Useful quotes:
- "Globalization tends to concentrate wealth, knowledge, and power in those already possessing these elements. International academic mobility similarly favors well-developed education systems and institutions, thereby compounding existing inequalities"
- "Universities have been international institutions from their medieval European origins, attracting students and faculty from many countries. The rise of nationalism and the nation-state after the Protestant Reformation focused academe inward. Later, the emergence of the Third World from colonialism in the mid-20th century stimulated the establishment of national universities. Now academe has regained its international scope and direction. Internationalization is propelled by IT, the knowledge economy, an integrated world economy, and increased mobility for students, faculty, programs, and providers"

**Tags:** Globalization; Univeristy; Inequality; Developing

Key terms:
- Globalization: The economic, technologiycal, and scientific trends that directly affect higher education and are largely innevitable. 
- Internationalization: includes specific programs and policies taken up by governments, institutions, and departments in order to cope with and exploit globalization
- Multinationalism: Academic programs from one country offered in another (think NYU Abu Dhabi)


The author discusses several aspects of the globalization of universtities, arguing that nothing about it is new, but that the increase international scope of universties will further existing inequalities. Specifically, the author points to:
- Universities having always been international in scope
- Students have always traveled abroad to study
- Globalization cannot be avoided—universiteis that shut themselves from changing society innevitably lose relevance
- Powerful universities have always dominated the production and diffusion of knowledge—lower institutions have followed
- Top academic instititoons require huge amounts of capital, for buildings, salaries, equiptment, and infrastructure—this high entry cost means that less-welathy institutions will struggle to compete 
- English is the modal language for science and higher education, a trend that benefits  English-spealing countries
- Migration, having awlays been central to academia, has increased in scope. Academics will take jobs in countries with more attractive opportunities, salaries and working conditions. At present, a small but significant exodus continues from the UK to the US and Canada because of the low salaries and deteriorating working conditions at home.
- In multinational agreements, such as when a university in a developed country parnters with a university in the developing world to offer a program, the rich country almost always dominates
- IT is central to globalization, and has helped increase the scope of university's globalization

This paper also has some interesting early discussion on brain drain and brain circulation, talking about the benefits of migrants to receiving countires

Useful quotes:
- "From the beginning, universities represented global institutions – in that they functioned in a common language, Latin, and served an international clientele of students. Professors, too, came from many countries, and the knowledge imparted reflected scholarly learning in the Western world at the time."
- "...some academics from South Korea and Taiwan, for example, returned from the United States or other countries to accept senior academic appointments in their home countries once academic working conditions, salaries and respect for academic freedom had improved. More commonly, academics return home for lectures or consulting, collaborate on research with colleagues in their country of origin, or accept visiting professorships."

Appelt et al.,

**Tags:**  Bibliometrics, Mobility

The authors of this OECD report examine what country-level factors influence the flow of researchers across countires, using bibliometric data. Their main findings are:

- Mobility is complicated, better understood as "brain circulation" than as "brain grain/drain"
- Visa restrictions between countires are associated with less mobility
- Mobility also related to economic conditions—similar economies tend to have more shared mobility

**Tags:** Demography, Mobility, Bibliometrics

The authors do a simple bibliometric analysis of "highly-mobile" researchers, those that have been affiliated within at least 3 countries during the period of study. They observe the emergence of the US and China as two large hubs, followered by Germany and France as two smaller hubs for highly mobile researchers. 

I don't really like this paper—they don't really add anything new. Plus, they have a lot of discussion about so-called "super-movers", but don't offer any comparisons to non-mobile or regularly-mobile scholars, meaning that we don't know what is unique to this population. 

The main takeaways are:
- brain circulation a better fit than drain/gain
- US and China have emerged as hubs
- The notion of "super movers" or "peripatetic" scholars, the word derived from Aritotle's school.

**Tags:** Simulation; Modelling; Mobility; Innovation; Implications

The authors build a numerical simulation model based around innovation, and through running it find that "mobility" between groups tends to lead to invreased innovation. They however do not confirm this model with real data, and so it is difficult to do much with this paper except cite it as another example of how mobility is beneficial for innovation

**Tags:** Europe; Brain Drain' Brain Circulation; Mobility; Collaboration


The authors focus on the 2004 EU enlargemnt, when many member states were added to the union, and compared the rates of cross-border collabroation before and after. They find that the rate of cross-boder publications and collaboration would have been higher if the member states weren't added, which was driven by the regional differences in the impact of emigration, and the high-level of emigration from East to Weat. 

This is parly attributed to the idea that "When a researcher not onlymoves abroad
but also brings his or her international links along, this represents a loss
of social capital—in addition to human capital and tacit knowledge
(33, 34)—that may further reduce the potential for knowledge spillovers
across countries."

An OECD report outlining the demographics and mobility pattenrs of doctorate holders between 1998 and 2006. Their main findings are that:
- More doctorate holders are being produced
- While doctorate holders have an employment premium, they also face many challenges such as bad working conditions, low salaries, etc., which are compounded for women
- The labor market of doctorate holders is more intenrational than other similarly-educated professions. 15-30% of holders reported mobility abroad in the past 10 years. 
- Intra-european migrations dominates European mobility, especially towards the United Kingdom, France, and Germany
- The other dominant pattern of mobility is from Asia to the United States, principally from China, India, and South korea
- Many doctorate holders obtain a doctorate in their host country, whereas another large proportion obtains a doctorate in their home country, and moves afterwards

Using a set of over 10,000 career histories of elite life scientists, the authors investigate factors influencing their moves. Their main findings are:

- Prolific scientsits are more likely to move
- Moves are driven in part by how much the "quality" of the peer network improves, i.e., if the scientist will move to stronger/more prestigious places
- Elite life scientists are less likely to move when they have been awarded a NIH grant due to the costs in transferring it between institutions
- Family is important—scientsits are less likely to move just before or while they have a child in high school, the period of childhood when moves would lead to the most disruption

**Tags:** Patents; Inventors; Nations

The authors investigate the effects of the migrtion of inventors on a country's technological advantage. They find that, for a given technological area, doubling the number of inventors in that area (through migration) correponds to a 25-60% increase in the likelihood of having an advantage in that area of tech (measured in RCA) in the next decade. In many areas of technology, this doubling of inventors can be as low as 25 people.

Basically, inventors immigration bolster national technology competativeness in their area of specialty.

**Tags:** Domestic; Mobility; Production; Germany

Investigates how "post-doctoral" mobility among German Economics nad Management faculty, that is, institutions held between their PhD-granting and employer institutions, affects publication. Finds evidence that moving univeristies in PostDoc reduces number of publications. This is attributed to a loss in social capital, in temrs of colleagues and collaborators, during the move. This paper exmaines only within-country mobility for German scholars. Also of note: many german universities tacitly require this post-doctoral period. 

- "Mobile researchers with more social ties in the form of coauthors or colleagues at the doctorate granting institution publish less in the years following the doctorate, than their less connected counterparts"
- "With respect to implications of the findings, mobility seems to cause a loss of social capital, which—somewhat surprisingly—not only relates to aresearcher’s weak ties (colleagues), but also to the strong ones, i.e. coauthors. Apparently, coauthorships are still driven by proximity, even given the advances in technology."

**Tags:** Mobility; Labor Market; Theory

A detailed theoretical discussion is provided conceptualizing academic mobility through a labour market perspective. the author provides three main conclusions:

- Academia operates as a separate and distinct labor market from other high-skilled professions. It has its own structures and practices of mobility, supprt from national, supranational, and institutional infrastructure, a habitus that valorized mobility, and opportunities to accumulate human and social capital through mobility
- Mobility is generally seen as an advantage by academics, offering the chance to accumulate social capital and improve ones competativeness in the academic job market. In particular, short-term and transnational mobility can increase the value of their labor. Women, however, experience limited mobility. Also, mobility might not always be an advantage, as it might remove academics from more local career opportunities
- Academic mobility is distinct from other labor market segments, but policies supporting academic mobility may have benefits for occupations such as entrepenuers and business people. But while academics are privelaged when it comes to mobility, there is also hardship—increased mobility can have negative impacts on individual's social networks and family. 


Additionally, this paper makes several interesting points
- Via a labor market persepctive, researchers can take a more critical view of academic mobility, focusing on its more negative aspects
- Mobility is viewed as a normal, and perhaps expected fact of academic like. It is often valorized and viewed as a good thing. The author says that academia thus has a "habitus" of mobility. Stays in foreign countires expand networks and provides cross-national perspectives on science. 
- In contrast to other sectors, mobility in academia is largely self-organized by the desires and career aspirations of individual academics hoping to network and expand their social space.

The study is based on a questionarie sent to foreign researchers in Italty and Portugal. 

Controlling for factors such as age and research area, this paper examines the mobility of 497 foreign researchers in Italy and Portugal and finds that the presence of home-linkages benefits both sending and receiving country and indirectly expands scientific networks. For migrant scientists, social linkages back to their home countries, such as collaborations with businesses or colleagues in their origin country, or specialized online social networks, can increase a scientist’s productivity, and probability or returning home. 

But the authors also conclude that mobility is not always positive, stating that especially when job opportunities in their home country are few, return is unlikely.  The findings favor policies focused on the creation of networks among mobile researchers and their countries of origin, especially involvement in diaspora networks and professional associations, which appear to have the largest impact on the probability of return.

The authors survey European researchers employed both by universities and research institution settings about their history and perceptions of mobility. Findings include:

- mobility is a fact of life for most European researchers
- research visits (short-term stays) are the most common form of mobility
- students participating in international collaboration are more likely to be mobile during their career
- A majority of researchers in both universities and non-university settings believed that mobility would benefit a researcher’s career, even by those who have never been mobile. T
- Men are proportionally more likely to be mobile

The author examines how the incidence of immigrants over time relate to the wages of hired doctorate holders in the United States. Borjas finds that a 10% increase in High-Skilled immigrants correponds to a 3-4% decrease in wages, about half of which seems caused by more soft-money Post-Doc positions. The rest is assumed as stemming from a softening labor market.

Using the collapse of the Soviet Union as a natural experiment, the authors examine the inpacts of the influx of soviet mathematicians into the U.S. labor market. 

They find consistent evidence that American mathematicians did not experience large net beneficial productivity spillovers from the Soviets. Instead, American mathematicians voluntarily (and involuntarily) chose to work on different topics in response, and were crowded out from both the labor and publications market. Moreover, the total productivity of Mathematics as a field didn't increase, so the "pie" didn't grow.

Using the sudden migration of Soviet Mathematicians as a case study, the authors examine the "cognitive mobility" of U.S. mathematicians. They find that the "supply shock" of new Soviet mathematicians lead pre-existing U.S. mathemticians to relocate to topics that didn't have many soviet emigrants. Moreover, U.S. Mathematics graduates systematically avoided Soviet-dominated topics for 2 decade period following the Soviet influx.

**Tags:** OECD; Mobility; Highly-skilled

I haven't read the full report, but the executive summary lays out the following key points:
- The scale and complexity of migration of S&T workers is increasing, playing an important role in shaping the OECD area
- Mobility facilitates the diffusion of knoweldge, particularly tacit knoweldge that is more effectively transferred among individuals with a common social context and physical proximity.
- Economics, but also access to funding and prestigious researchers drive this mobility. Family and personal ties also draw people to be mobile.
- Mobile workers transfer knoweldge. They transfer knwoeldge directly to colleagues, and there is also geographic spillover to nearby individuals and organizations. Mobile S&T workers are as important as the flow of goods and capital across borders
- Receiving countires benefit from the inflow of S&T workers, such as increased R&D and exonomic activity. Mobility can also link domestic firms with foreign knoweldge and expertise. 
- (then)-existing literature was focused on brain drain, but there is this new idea of "brain ciruclation", positing benefits in both directions, that should be considered. 
- For the sending (origin) country, mobility can benefit the creation and diffusion of knwoeldge in the home country. S&T workers going to larger and denser economices can accumulate human capital faster than they could at home
- Brain circulation can stimulate knwoeldge flows and build links between locations. Mobility of S&T workers is not a zero-sum game. But, origin countires should have the infrastructure and institutions to absorb return migrants.
- The existence of a diaspora can further spur knoweldge flows, creating a conduit between countires. In some emerging economies, diaspora networksplay a vital role in developing science and technology capacity
- Most OECD countries are net beneficiaries of highly skilled migration. The United States, Canada, Australia, and France, in  particular, have experienced strongly positive net inflows of tertiary-educated migrants. However, in relative terms, New Zealand and  Ireland  have  experienced  large  outflows. 
- Students are increasingly mobile. Data show that the number ofstudents enrolled outside their country of citizenship has risen sharply since 1995
- Many long-term migrants eventually return to their home contries. The likelihood of doing so for those who are at greater geographic, cultural, and economic distance from their home countries. The  decision  to  return  is  driven  strongly  bylifestyle and family considerations and the availability of attractive employment opportunities at home. For students, the considerations are similar 
- Direct evidence of the impact of mobility on innovation outcomes is hard to find. 
- A clear effect of the mobility of highly skilled workers is the  increasing internationalisation of the labour market for the highly skilled. Both in privateindustry and academia, foreign staff are sought for their specific knowledge orabilities, their language skills and their knowledge of foreign markets
- Opportunities for mobility have been growing. Many countries  havegreatly improved their ability to exploit and perform research and innovationover the past decade. 
- There are many kinds of policies for leveraging mobile S&T workers, but few countires have an explicit strategy for doing so. 
- There are many mobility policies, but they have often not been evaluated. 
- Removing barriers to circular mobility and fostering the diaspora may prove fruitful. Shorter (and potentially repeated) periodsabroad  may avoid some of the obstacles that currently hinder mobility,  and would support knowledge flows associated with brain circulation and  the diaspora
- The growing competition for talent is growing. Many OECD countries  and a growing range of non-member economies aim to attract the same pool of highly skilled researchersand scientists. Relying  extensively on international flows and mobility policies to fill  existing or future gaps in supply may therefore entail risks. Policy will also need to focus on addressing shortcomings in national policiesthat may limit the supply of HRST.

**Tags:** Spain; Short-term; Gender; Bibliometrics

In this paper, Cañibano et al. use data form the Scientific Information System of Andalusian (SICA) to analyze the frequency, duration, and destinations of short-term mobility (such as research visits) between male and female researchers in Spain. 
- Women are underrepresented across all disciplines, more so in some fields, like engineering and computer sciences. 
- Researchers are mobile when they have at least one publication
- A greater percentage of women than men are mobile. 
- Women are more likely to become mobile earlier in their career. 
- But while women are more often mobile, and mobile earlier in their career, their research visits tend to be shorter than men’s, and their destinations more nearby. 

The authors interpret these results as women often performing more “care-work” activities than men, such as taking primary responsibility for child rearing and housework; as such, women may be pressured to take mobility opportunities that do not significantly impact or disrupt their life. But women are also more likely to be mobile than men, which is interpreted as women facing discriminatory practices in institutions, forcing them to be more mobile to search for opportunities. Thus, by analyzing the short-term visits of researchers, the authors reveal differences between men and women researching in Andalusia, and particularly provide evidence to the different pressures that affect them.

**Tags:** CV; Spain

The authors examine 1,711 standardized CVs submitted in 2005 by applicants to the Spanish Ramón y Cajal funding program, which seeks to incorporate doctoral holders into national research systems. The CVs are partitioned into Physics and Space Science, Molecular Biology, and Philosophy and Philology. Researchers are manually coded to differentiate short-, medium-, and long-term research stays, as well as country and “center” or “inter-institutional” mobility. 

The authors found:

- Little age difference (likely because the program targets young-career researchers), that there are 
- That there stark “mobility cultures” between disciplines: Physics and Space Sciences as the most mobile, while Molecular Biology is the least.  
- Productivity clusters, wherein humanists publish far more books and articles without ISSNs, while molecular biologics produce less than the physical sciences. 
- No positive relationship between mobility and research performance, contradicting intuition and the views of policy makers. In fact, the authors found that for molecular biologists, there is a negative relationship.

Studies disciplinary differences in short-term mobility (length between one week and 2 years) using Spanish researcher's CVs. 
- The majority of Andalusian authors registered no research visits (~60%)
- The discipline with the greatest mobility were the social sciences (47.3%), following by the humanities (41.6%), environmental sciences (41.5%), life sciences at 27%, and in last place, science and technology of health (19.6%)
- In past research that held a definition of research that precluded short-term stays, social sciences and humanities had some of the least mobility. But in these fields short-term mobility is incredibly common
- Mobility is also found to start generally in the pre-doctoral period, but later in life than average for the social sciences and humanities.

**Tags:** Human Capital; Theory

Takes a history persepctive on mo ility to exmaine how ideas on brain drain have changed over time. the authors argue that while the brain drain is partly due to disparities of scientific development between countries, the “most fundamental problem is the conceptual conflation of the demographic category of skilled human resources for science and technology (HRST) and the economic concept of human capital (HC)”.

The authors start their analysis at the brain drain debate of the 1960s, where two perspectives of brain drain were common, the Nationalist-pessimistic (Stocks of professionals) and the internationalist-optimistic (flows/sharing of professionals). Subsequent approaches to the debate focused on market forces completing individuals with high value (skills, knowledge) to emigrate or seek education abroad; most models of this type perceived high-skilled emigration as detrimental to developing sending countries, although others also proposed the idea of brain gain, arguing that developing countries benefit from sending researchers to other countries. 

Discussion on circulation follows, which is then proceeded by another review of the literature on Diaspora Knowledge Networks, which likely reconfigure human-capitol distributions and whose effects are largely contingent on the specific circumstances. The authors close by saying that human capitol is complicated and should not be represented as an aggregate (unlike HRST), “but as distributed across heterogeneous structures embedded in time and space; variably context dependent and therefor nor automatically transferrable; and complementary to other assets that make it valuable”. 

Mobility is complicated. Mobility is hard. Mobility is context-dependent. There is no good theory yet, and caution should be used when analyzing results. This paper is great in that it provides a thorough historical tour of the debates in mobility and migration.

**Tags:** Productivity; Tenure; Policy

Focuses on inter-institutional mobility and the problem of “inbreeding” in science in the Spanish university context. Academic inbreeding is considered to be when a university hires a new professor who is a graduate from their program, and some even extend this definition to include graduates from similar programs (such as Ivy Leagues only hiring Ivy League graduates). 
- Spain has very little mobility across the board, 
- Contrary to results from U.S. based studies, the authors find no evidence that institutional mobility, whether inbreeding or not, affects their scientific performance later in their career. 
- Higher productivity does not affect the awarding of early tenure, that women are half as likely to get tenure early in their career, and that there are differences in the awarding of early tenure between fields.

**Tags:** Globalization; Mobility; Visa; Temporal

The authors look at country-level mobility data between 1970 and 2014  and identify several trends in global scientific mobility:
- There is increasing diveristy in origin and destination countires, with the so-called "Global South" becoming more integrated into the global scientific system at the expense of three major regions: North America, Northern Europe, and Western Europe
- The "center of gravity" of scientific knoweldge production and destiniations has been steadily moving eastwards
- The average distnace travelled by mobile scientists has been increasing, reflecting the integration of the "peripheries" into the global science system
- There are significantly lower frictions/barriers to mobility for scientists than for other non-scientist migrants
- But visa restrictions are a statistically significant barrier/friction to the mobility of scientists

Other than that, this paper has really pretty circle graphs and notes that while the shape of mobility has changed, there has been relatively little change in shapes of mobility over the past 40 years. 
- The proportion of scietnsits who had mobility in the last 2 years has been about 3%
- The proportion with mobility in the past decade has been about 9%

**Tags:** Visa; Mobility; Politics


The authors examine the tempral evoltuion of visa policies around the world using a database of national migratory policies. Their findings challenge the notion of a "North-South" mobility divide, instead finding evidence for a multi-polar world made up of regional blocs, wherein travel is more free. In addition, the find,

- That inbound visa restrictions have been stable since the 1970s
- That exit visa restrictions have fell dramatically 
- regional integration drives the liberalization of visa laws
- Countires in sub-Saharan Africa, South, and Southeast Asia have the highest levels of visa restrictiveness in the world


In addition, they also outline a complex array of reasons explaining how visas regimes might manifest
- As domestic political tools to back up rhetoric—for eaxmple, Trump putting bans on certain countires
- As retaliation for a diplomatic incident with another country, or bilateral retaliation in response to restrictions being placed on one country
- As concillatory response, i.e., both agree to lift restrictions

There are also several miscelenous points made about visas and their reasonoings:
- Visas can be required or revoked relatively easily by national governments, making them appealing diplomatic or rhetorical tools
- Might be added as domestic political tools to back up rhetoric—for eaxmple, Trump putting bans on certain countires
- Might be added as retaliation for a diplomatic incident with another country, or bilateral retaliation in response to restrictions being placed on one country
- Could be revoked as a concillatory response, i.e., both agree to lift restrictions
- States that percieve themselves to be, or want to appear democratic might lift exit visa restrictions
- Visas can refelct power asymetries, i.e., if country X imposes visas on country Y, but not the reverse, than country X probably has more political and economic power over country Y
  - This is illustrated in the paper using the cases of the Netherlands, France, and Morocco

**Tags:** Mobility; Germany; Industry; Knowledge Transfer

The authors investigate how international mobility relates to Knowledge and Technology Transfer (KTT), roughly meaning the transfer of knwoeldge between, typically from, Science to Industry (such as patents, licensisng, collaborations, and visits). The idea is that mobility would lead to more human capital, which in turn increases the likelihood of KTT. 

The authors survey ~950 German researchers in various STEM fields likely to be involved in Industry about their activity in KTT and short and long-term mobility. In doing so, they reveal a host of insights:

1. Mobile researchers were more productive than non-mobile researchers in terms of publications
2. 80% of mobile researchers stated that their mobility was funded through grants, but only one fifth were satisfied with their level of funding for such travel
3. KTT is not a zero-sum game between host and destination countris—scientists who transfer knoweldge & tech do so both at home and abroad, and its complementary!
4. The longer a scientist's research visit, the more likely they are to engage in KK in both the host and the home country
5. The more frequent a scientist is mobile, the more they engage in KTT in their home country. This means that a country benefits even though their scientists are frequenty abroad. 
6. University scientsits are much more likely to be mobile but less likely to transfer knoweldge & tech internationally than scientists from public research instituties (klike Max PLanck's)

Freeman, 2006

This report from 2006 authored by Richard Freeman, a famous Harvard economist, details four propositions about the state of the globalizing scientific system adn its impats on the U.S.,

1. The U.S. is profucing fewer S&E graduates, and its global share is decreasing rapidly as European and Asian countires, especially China, educate more 
2. The job market has worsened for U.S. workers in S&E fields relative to other occupations, discouraging students from pusruing these degrees. The lack of U.S. S&E graduates has partially been mitigated by a flow of foreign scientists.
3. Populous and (then) low-income countires can compete with the U.S. by producing numerous graduates, even if only a small share of their populations. This could upend global trade and industrial dynamics
4. The United State's comparaing advantage in high-tech is diminishing, which will create a long period of adjustment for U.S. workers

The author calls for new workforce policies to help the U.S. in this transition, policies that build on local strenghts and benefit from the scientific achievemnets of other countries. The main tool the U.S. gov has is R&D spending

A short popular-oriented piece arguing that trends in the U.S. fortell losing its advantage in attracting highly-skilled migrants. Since 2016, there are fewer H1-B applicants and fewer postgraduate applicants. Kerr argues these are in part due to:
- hostile political rhetoric
- Outdated and insufficient immigration systems
- Other barrier smaking it harder to establish businesses

The authors examine the extent to which fluctuations in the H-1B visa cap between 1995 and 2008 relates to the incidence of patenting among those with Chinese and Indian family names in U.S. cities. They find that immigrants are especially important for U.S. innovation. Fluctuations in H-1B admissions significantly influenced the rate of Indian and Chinese patentintg in cities, relative to their peers. Total invention increased with higher H-1B admissions primarily through the contributions of immigrant inventors.

**Tags:** Europe; Mobility; Country; Univeristy

The authors compare the relevance of country-level and institutional-level factors in attracting foreign talent in a small set of European countires. They find that country-level factors are the most important, and even high-ranking research-intensive univeristies in non-attractive countires struggle to attract foreign talent. Also, research-focused, as compared to teaching-focused institutions have more foreign students, faculty and staff. They speculate that by opening academic labor marker,s that rich countires will likel benefit, wheras the impact on poorer countires is less certain. 

Their metrics for attractiveness are based on the number of faculty and staff, and their research intesnsity

Petersen, 2018

**Tags:** Impact, Discipline, Co-authors, Mobility

The authors examines instances of international mobility and finds that mobile researchers in Physics gain up to a 17% increase in citations relative to similar peers. This increase can be explained by changes in their diveristy of co-authors and topics of interest. It might be the case that migrations afford new opportuniteis to grow social capital and expand/change the immediate, exhausted co-authorship network. 

Other interesting bits:
- "Our findings suggest that career benefits of mobility are common to all ranks"
- "We also fonud that 34% of the mobile researchers in our analysis moved to a location that was not in their sphere of prior collaborations"
- "In this way, migration affords a prime opportunity to phase our old (possibly stagnant) collabroations and research topics in order to make way for exploring new (potentially lucrative) avenues."
- "A hypothetical mechamism that emerges firectly from our analysis of the research diveristy variables is that mobility increases the likelihood of drawing together different intellectual cpacities and professional experience distributed across researchers, which when combined provide a valuable perspective on how to best advance research efforts"

**Tags:** network; temporal; multi-level; institutions

The authors measure the flow of researchers between institutions, cities, and countries, to assess the strength of collaborative relationships.

This is actually very similar to what I am proposing, however, this paper also has several limitations that I think we can build upon.

- The authors define career trajectories, choosing cities in the case when multiple are present. This assumption does not fit with notions of mobility, which is more circulation than flow.
- The authors use the Medline dataset, which limits their disciplinary focus to biomedical fields
- The authors focus on small subsets of universities/cities
- The authors make measurements based on shortest path distance and trajectories, but this might not be straightforward. For example, if the U.S. U.K. and Japan are connected by a distance of 1, are their relationships really equal?
- The authors have no way to effectively compare between scales or identify deviating examples. I.e., its difficult to calculate a "center" in a graph structure to calculate distance from. We, however, can do this.
- The authors do not have a good means of comparing changes over time

The global economic center of gravity is shifting eastwards, towards China. Projected forward in time, it will eventually sit at the "flat earth" center, meaning that it will match the population center of the world. This paper lays out the approach for calculating economic geographic centers of gravity.

The authors look at scientific production based on country, and calculate the temporal center of gravity of publications from 1900 to 2010. ARound 1900, the center was much nearer to the U.S., however over the decades this has shifted to instead sit somewhere in the Mediterranean. 

The paper mostly works as a brief historical piece, tracking the changing dynamics of scientific production over the century. They also remark on the exponetnial growth in scientific articles, which they attribute to the importance of science worldwide.
